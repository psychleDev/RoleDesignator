i have one wordpress page and two plugins (so far). The journal Plugin and The Archive plugin. Id like to create a "role designator" plugin for wordpress that assigns different roles based on the type of user i have. Id like the users to be "menoffire" users with full access to all plugins and "ignite30" users who only have access to what i choose.


// This plugin provides:

// Two custom roles:

// menoffire: Full access to both Journal and Archive plugins
// ignite30: Access to Journal only


// Admin features:

// Role management page under "Role Designator" in the admin menu
// Bulk actions to set users as either Men of Fire or Ignite 30
// Individual user role switching


// Helper function rd_can_access() that other plugins can use to check permissions

// To use this in your other plugins, you would do something like:

// In your Journal plugin
if (rd_can_access('journal')) {
    // Show journal content
}

// In your Archive plugin
if (rd_can_access('archive')) {
    // Show archive content
}
